Collection from various sources that worked for me as a beginner, main sources are reddit for the HackNet.ns, scan.js and stock-trader.ns. All others are from the follow, but fixed for the steam version 1.2:

Commands for main hacking/money making method early game:
run runHacking (main script that hacks servers, makes money and purchaces and upgrades new servers)
run HackNet (only profitable for long games, not if you install augments often)
run stock-trader (not tested much but it makes a profit, game needs to be active so no offline)
run killAll (kill all scripts and restart hacking scripts)
